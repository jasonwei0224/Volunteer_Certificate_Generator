## General info
I started the project when I was working as a volunteer coordinator at Asian-Canadian Special Events Association. 
During the time there, I was responsible for over 100 volunteers in both Vancouver and Toronto. Everytime after the
events we are required to sent out electronic volunteer certificate. The mass amount of volunteer certificate takes a
long time to generate and the mailmerge function provided by Google Sheet had a limit. I created this application, hoping
to use it in the future to automatically generate volunteer certificate from a word document(using it as a template) with the correct name, hours, 
and automatically transfer it into a pdf file and send them to the volunteers.
